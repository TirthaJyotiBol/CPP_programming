    We have - Short , long ,int , long long // 
    
    float num = 28.98;
    cout<<"number is : "<<num;
    
    
    we can use const to keep the value same all over the program
    
    int const num = 32;
    cout<<"without change : "<<num<<endl;
     num =23;
    cout<<"after change :" <<num<<endl;  // give ERROR
